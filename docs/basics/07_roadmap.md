# Roadmap

***Last updated - 27 February 2024***

The roadmap for the Service Framework as it stands is centred around a set of features that would be useful to implement in the future, there ar eno timelines currently associated with these features at this time and are provided on a "when resource is available" basis.

> [The managed roadmap for the Service Framework can be found here](https://github.com/orgs/realitycollective/projects/1)

In highlight the main items the team are reviewing to enhance the Service Framework are:

* UI: Enabling the Services list to highlight configured services in Green if they are working / activated as expected and RED if there is an issue.
* Editor: Enabling the **Service Hook** feature to allow properties to be editable at Editor runtime.
* Architecture: Implement the Dependency Injection pattern to define dependent interfaces at design time and have the framework ensure dependent services are available during initialization.

> For any other required features, please log requests on the [Service Framework repository](https://github.com/realitycollective/com.realitycollective.service-framework/issues).
